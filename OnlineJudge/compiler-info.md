# Compiler Info

Currently we support

# Java 8
# Java 11

The JDK's for these languages will **not** be uploaded to the git repo, due to their file size. However, to test locally,
install the JDKs from oracle into this directory, and change the compilation/execution commands to reflect the correct language

Production server will have compilers installed
